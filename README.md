# Music-recommendation #
The vast availability of music online has made discovering new and relevant tracks increasingly difficult for users. Personalized recommendation systems have become essential tools to enhance user experience on digital platforms. This project focuses on developing a music recommendation web application that leverages user interaction data to generate customized playlists. The aim is to simplify music discovery by analyzing
listening behavior and providing intelligent song suggestions.

# Problem Statement #
With millions of tracks available across streaming services, users often find it challenging to identify music that aligns with their preferences. Manual browsing is time-consuming and can lead to user fatigue. Although existing platforms offer recommendation features, they are often opaque or computationally heavy. There is a need for a lightweight, user-friendly system capable of delivering accurate recommendations using a clear and effective algorithmic approach.

# Objectives #
The project was undertaken with the following objectives:
1. Develop a web-based application for music recommendation.
2. Implement a content-based recommendation engine using cosine similarity.
3. Enable user interactions such as listening, rating, and playlist creation.
4. Provide real-time, personalized playlists based on user activity.
5. Design a responsive and intuitive user interface using standard web technologies.


# Algorithm and Approach #
The core recommendation mechanism is built upon cosine similarity, a widely used method
for measuring the similarity between vectors. The implementation process includes:
● Data Collection: Capturing user activity, including song plays, ratings, and playlist
interactions.
● Vector Representation: Encoding songs and user preferences as numerical vectors.
● Similarity Computation: Using cosine similarity to compare vectors and determine
the closeness between different songs.
● Recommendation Generation: Filtering and ranking tracks based on similarity scores
to those previously engaged with by the user.
● Playlist Display: Presenting a dynamically generated playlist tailored to the user’s
preferences.
This approach ensures that recommendations are both efficient and relevant, enhancing the
overall listening experience.

# Music-recommendation #
The vast availability of music online has made discovering new and relevant tracks increasingly difficult for users. Personalized recommendation systems have become essential tools to enhance user experience on digital platforms. This project focuses on developing a music recommendation web application that leverages user interaction data to generate customized playlists. The aim is to simplify music discovery by analyzing
listening behavior and providing intelligent song suggestions.

# Problem Statement #
With millions of tracks available across streaming services, users often find it challenging to identify music that aligns with their preferences. Manual browsing is time-consuming and can lead to user fatigue. Although existing platforms offer recommendation features, they are often opaque or computationally heavy. There is a need for a lightweight, user-friendly system capable of delivering accurate recommendations using a clear and effective algorithmic approach.
